(Documents are chunked into overlapping segments and embedded using fastembed.) Tj T*
T*
(The embedding model used is nomic-embed-text-v1.5 which produces 768-dimensional vectors.) Tj T*
T*
(Semantic similarity is computed using cosine distance in the vector space.) Tj T*
T*
(The system supports ingestion of PDF Word PowerPoint Excel HTML and image formats.) Tj T*
